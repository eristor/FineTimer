Hello. This is my pet project regular timer. This timer has 2 modes. The first mode of working time, and the second mode of time for rest.
The project itself has 2 key pages. The first is the timer page, and the other is the time settings page. The timer page contains: timer, start/pause button and settings button. The settings page has 2 sliders for work time and rest time respectively and a button to return to the main page.
Here are some screenshots of the project.
